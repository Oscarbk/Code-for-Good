                    <p>I have worked in the Madrichim program, which is where teenagers can be assistant teachers in classrooms at religious school at my temple for a few years now, and a couple of years ago they were advertising a class about how to babysit children with special needs at the Jewish Community Center (JCC) nearby. It was an amazing experience, I learned a lot about Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and most of all I learned how to be more inclusive. After the class was over I was put on their list of people certified to babysit people with special needs, for parents to give a call when they needed an experienced person to watch their kids.</p>

<p>I had never expected to receive a call but one day I did. I babysat for a child with ADHD where I learned a lot, but recently started to babysit a child on the Autism Spectrum where I am learning even more.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, we were writing our Sophomore Research Paper which also had the theme of ASD. My angle was the portrayal in the media. I learned how often autism is portrayed offensively, incorrectly, and how it has such a large effect on the people’s view of the disorder. Not only are these movies and TV shows being discriminatory, they are also giving false information to the public. It is extremely important for people to understand autism, and advocate for it. I emphasized that joining a walk is great, but if you really want to contribute then help others get informed. Host a session where people who understand the disorder can speak so more and more people can accept the community of people who have this disorder. Therefore, get informed and understand before you believe all of the things you see on TV.</p>

<p>There is a part of the Madrichim Program called Mayan which I will be joining next year. This is an inclusive learning style for people with special needs, and I am more than excited to be a part of this!</p>

<p>I am looking forward to writing more about my experiences with autism, so be sure to check back for more!</p>
