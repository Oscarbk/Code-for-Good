The past two weeks of research have been amazing, I never have learned so much, and never thought I would know so much about babies. 

This lab does a bunch of different studies, but the one I am doing is what we call Language and Social Evaluation. Grown humans within milliseconds label someone as sketchy, scary, trustworthy, etc., and we do it subconsciously. If someone who looked nice and then did something mean like push you to the ground, you would be surprised. We are testing the same with infants. I wonâ€™t be going into specifics now, but I will be sure to share my work with you at the end of the summer, but right now I am not permitted to do so. 

Coming into the lab I expected to be treated as a high school student like I am. However, unlike some of the other labs in the program I am treated like a normal lab member. On the daily I am making phone calls, coding, and basically doing anything that is asked of me. 

Outside of the lab, the UMass Amherst campus is absolutely amazing. The sunsets are gorgeous, the people are great, and I am truly getting a sense of what it is like to be a college student. 

One thing that is truly amazing about this program is that I am meeting people from all over the country. Everyone here is unique in their own academic and social lives. Being immersed in a group of teens who are extremely intelligent is truly amazing, and I learn something new everyday just by having daily conversations. 

Although I am not in Israel like I thought I might be as mentioned in a previous post, I am still having a once in a lifetime experience here at UMass, and I will never forget it. 

Be sure to check back for more information about my research and other awesome things about this summer!
