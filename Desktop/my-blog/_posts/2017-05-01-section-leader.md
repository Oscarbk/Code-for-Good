lead_text: Marching band has been an extreme part of my high school experience, and I am super excited to give back by serving my band as a section leader!

My freshman year in high school I had found a great community of people within the band. It made my transition to a new school so much easier, and it still is giving me an extremely rewarding experience. 

During my first year, all of the seniors and the drum majors or section leaders worked super hard to make my time at band as best as it could, and brought extreme success to us all as we won the national championship that year. I learned so much that season, growing as a musician and as an individual while also making a bunch of new friends. 

Flash forward two years and I am running for section leader and drum major. This required a lot of time and effort. Written applications, interviews, teaching and conducting auditions, etc. I wanted to give back to the community that gave me so much for two years, and I worked super hard so I could do so. 

In the end, my hard work payed off and I got section leader! As time went on I got more and more excited. I will be carrying on the legacy of the amazing leaders that came before me, carrying on traditions from the past, and giving all of the band members the greatest experience possible.  

I do not think I truly understand what it means to be section leader yet, but as the season starts and the responsibilities add up I definitely will!
 
Be sure to check back as I will definitely be writing about my new experience as section leader.
