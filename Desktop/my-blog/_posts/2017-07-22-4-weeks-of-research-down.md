Itâ€™s hard to believe that I have been here at UMass for four weeks and that summer will be over before I know it! 

I have made a bunch of great friends who are extremely intelligent, pushing me to my full potential, and also showing me where the future of research is headed. It is amazing being immersed in a community where everyone is spending their spare time trying to learn about new things, and actually interested in what everyone has to say. Outside the lab we have done things like hiking or taking a bus to the nice town nearby. Coming to a program knowing nobody was an interesting experience as it was hard to find my place at first. However, it brought experiences that will be helpful for the rest of my life. For example, networking for a job will require interacting with strangers, and I am one step ahead!

I have also learned a numerous amount of things inside the lab which I would never have learned otherwise. From creating a graph on Excel or dissecting a sheep brain, I have learned more that what I expected to. Whether my paper gets published or not, I have learned what it means to be a researcher. I learned how to collect and analyze data, recruit participants, thoroughly read a scientific article, and so much more. In a normal science class at school we may do a lab which involves testing a hypothesis and following the scientific method. However, I have been doing that every single day, and we are not doing an experiment that is just for learning purposes and we already know what to expect like we do in school.  This is real research where we do not know what we will find. Furthermore, when many think of research they think of chemicals and lab coats, but psychology research is different, and that is why I like it. 

Overall, this summer has been an incredible experience, and I am excited to see what this last two weeks has in store! I will be posting soon about what my specific study is about, so be sure to check back!
