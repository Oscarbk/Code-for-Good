What an amazing 6 weeks at UMass Amherst. Not only did I learn about conducting research and get the idea of what living on a college campus is like, I was also surrounded by some of the smartest and creative high school students from all over the globe. 

I finished my paper, and I will soon be submitting it for which will be my first (hopefully) publication ever! I would not have been able to accomplish this without the help of the Infant Cognition Lab. 

On the second to last day of the program we held a poster session where all of my peers and I presented our work to each other, family and friends, and UMass faculty. It was amazing walking around knowing how much growth and inspiration had occurred with all of the people around me. 

As we all move on to greater things, I know that this is not goodbye, this is see you later. Whether it be a university, office, hospital, etc., this program brought together the future leaders of industries to the faces of medicine, but most of all, the group of students that will change the world. 

My next journey will be section leader as band starts next week! Check back to hear more!
