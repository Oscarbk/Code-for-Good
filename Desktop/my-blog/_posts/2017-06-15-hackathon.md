I mentioned in my first post about what a hackathon is, and how it got me into coding in the first place. Basically a hackathon is an overnight event where students code a game, app, website, etc. Different companies from the field come and students can network. These events are normally at colleges, but high school events are getting more and more popular. 

Getting this event to happen was much harder than I thought. I thought that the administration would love the idea and want it at our school as soon as possible. This would put our schools STEM department on the map, help us keep up with other high schools in the area already having these events, and overall giving a great experience to high school students. 

I grabbed some friends together, and we set up a meeting with the at the time Acting Principal. He turned us down, mostly because he was uncomfortable with having students from other high schools that he does not know overnight at our high school. This is a somewhat understandable concern, but there were many solutions to this problem. Major League Hacking (MLH) is an organization that oversees all of these events and has onsite staff the day of the event just incase something goes wrong. However, this was not good enough. 

I did not stop there. I knew how much this could do for our students, and scheduled a meeting with the Superintendent. I felt that since the Principal was “acting” and new to the job that it would make sense for him to be uncomfortable having an event like this. That is why I went to the Superintendent, who could possibly relieve some of his worries. However, they were not a fan either. 

My next step was inviting all of the administration that was involved to come to a hackathon at a high school nearby. The principal came, and he finally understood what this event was doing for students. Still uncomfortable with the overnight event, he decided he would be okay with a 12 hour event. Even though this was not out original goal, we will make this event an extreme success, and allow our hackathon to grow and hopefully one day be a 24 hour event. 

This taught me an extremely important lesson, to be persistent when passionate about something. If I took no for an answer, I would not be able to have the opportunity to give such a great academic experience to students. Overall, I will carry this lesson on and not be afraid to stand up, whether it is to an authority figure or not, when I find something I am passionate about. 

I will definitely be posting about the hackathon writing process so make sure to check back!
