About a year ago my interest in computer science began after attending my first hackathon, which when putting it simple, is a coding marathon for students. I was not taking computer science in school, and had basically no prior experience, but after the hackathon, with the guidance of my brother who is experienced in the field, I decided to create something of my own. 

I decided to build a blog using a static site generator called Jekyll which would establish a template and a starting point for this blog. However, being a beginner this was much more difficult than I anticipated. I would spend a couple hours accomplishing a simple task that an experienced programmer would be able to do in less than five minutes. I will admit that it was frustrating at times. For example, when there was a bug in the code causing the entire blog to go down in shreds which happened more than once. I probably decided started over 10 times before I finally got it right. However, I am now super excited to have a place to share my academic and social life from a website that I worked hard to create!

I will try to post as much as I can and I hope you enjoy!
