I have spent a lot of time trying to decide how to have the most worthwhile summer. I had two ideas. After being truly immersed in my Jewish community last summer I thought about going to Israel. I also considered being immersed in an academic environment like taking college courses or doing research on a college campus. I decided I would apply to some programs, and if I got in I would go, and if I got rejected I would go to israel. 

I was looking for research programs in the field of biology or chemistry, but then I found a program that provided psychology research at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Normally, when you think about research you think of syringes, lab coats, etc. I had never thought of doing psychology research before, but I applied and I got accepted. The research I will be doing is called Infant Cognition. This is how infants, even at preverbal stages can make decisions and can navigate the world around them. I will be sure to write about the research that I will be doing over the summer. 

Although I did not get to go to Israel, I still have a great opportunity in front of me. I will learn as much as I can, and get to feel what it is like to live on a college campus. Also, I will definitely be able to travel to israel later in my life. 

Overall, I am looking forward to letting you know about my summer!
